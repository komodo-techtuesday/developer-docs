## Getting started tips for developers

The best way to get started is to read the [Core Concepts](core-concepts) while working through the [Getting Started](getting-started) section and the [Guides](guides/guides).  

If you are looking to start creating network-level consensus by creating a crypto-condition module, be sure to learn how some of the existing solutions work in the [Focus](focus/focus) section so you don't have to re-invent the wheel.

Once you have the basic concepts down and are considering where to take your project, read through the [Ecosystem Services](ecosystem-services) section and [Infrastructure & Operations](infrastructure-operations) in the left hand menu.  A blockchain project is a collaborative effort, so be sure to share links with your colleagues to take advantage of the many features Komodo offers.  

Also, check out the [repository of examples in the TUI](#), as built by one of our testers who took a liking to python.
